# Course Gnome Scrape

This is a collection of dart programs to scrape course data from supported schools and upload it to the course_gnome backend. Until the app goes into beta, only GWU will be supported.

Scraping uses `http`, `html`, and `agolia-dart` packages. Courses are being stored in Agolia because of its search functionality.
